"""
NOTE:
ELO updates work like this:
- Start with the players' previous ELOs.
- Compute the expected win probability for each (based on rating difference).
- Compare expected result with actual result.
- Update each player's ELO: 
    new_rating = old_rating + K * (actual_score - expected_score)

Where:
- actual_score = 1 if player won, 0 if lost
- expected_score = probability of winning from the ELO formula
- K is the learning rate (controls how fast ratings move)

So the expected probability **scales** the size of the ELO change.

TODO: Possibly make K dynamic:
        - Early-career players: uncertain â†’ K *= (1 + max(0, 20 - matches_played)/20). Caps at 2x for debut, fades to 1x by 20 matches.
        - Best of 5 (increasing K)
        - LOWER K for surface ELO's maybe ???
